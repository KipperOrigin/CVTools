2.1.2017:

- Fix the sign editor (or remove, personally I like the set-command way better)
- Switching a skull type to one and back to 3 keeps the skull owner, is that on purpose? Or should it be deleted?
- Check the remove-commands, some throw out of bounds exceptions, not all are 1-based
- Limit Firework-power (?)
- PlayerEquipItem prints "null applied to player" if item has no name
- PotionEffectAdd: Defaults for level and duration don't work
- Remove player kick event handler

- Test on CV: Mobage/ai/attributes/equipment/itempickup/tame/untame, itemflags..., itemattributes..., itemtype


optional nice-to-haves or later (1.10):
- Armor stand invincible, no gravity, arms
- Test delayed task, stopwatch
